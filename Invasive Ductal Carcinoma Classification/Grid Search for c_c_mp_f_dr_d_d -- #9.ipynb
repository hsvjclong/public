positives and best identify negatives.  In order to combat this, it would be useful to use multiple models for the final prediction.  Three models are to be included:  one that best identifies positives, one that best identifies negatives, and one that is generally accurate with a relatively small gap between the sensitivity and specificity.  When predictions from these three models are made simultaneously, increased confidence in the overall prediction results when the predictions from the individual models agree with each other.  The parameters for each model to be used are listed below.\n","\n","**Good Specificity Model:**\n","\n","Filters in 1st Convolutional Layer:  64\n","\n","Filters in 2nd Convolutional Layer:  128\n","\n","Kernel Size (both convolutional layers):  (3, 3)\n","\n","Dropout Rate:  0.50\n","\n","Size of Hidden Dense Layer:  64\n","\n","Epochs to Train:  4\n","\n","**Good Sensitivity Model:**\n","\n","Filters in 1st Convolutional Layer:  16\n","\n","Filters in 2nd Convolutional Layer:  32\n","\n","Kernel Size (both convolutional layers):  (3, 3)\n","\n","Dropout Rate:  0.50\n","\n","Size of Hidden Dense Layer:  32\n","\n","Epochs to Train:  5\n","\n","**Good Overall Model:**\n","\n","Filters in 1st Convolutional Layer:  64\n","\n","Filters in 2nd Convolutional Layer:  32\n","\n","Kernel Size (both convolutional layers):  (3, 3)\n","\n","Dropout Rate:  0.50\n","\n","Size of Hidden Dense Layer:  64\n","\n","Epochs to Train:  5\n","\n","It is interesting to note that the convolutional neural network outperforms the random forest model but not by as much as was expected.
