This dataset consists of 277,524 color images (50 pixels by 50 pixels) generated from 162 slides of breast cancer cells scanned at 40x.  There are 198,738 images that correspond to negative results for IDC and 78,786 images that correspond to positive results for IDC.  The images are supplied in a set of folders that correspond to a particular patient.  Within each folder corresponding to a patient, there are two folders--one for positive-IDC images and one for negative-IDC images.  The code below serves to read each of these images from file and store them in a NumPy array for further use along with corresponding arrays that indicate the label.  This is done in batches of 100,000 images due to RAM restrictions.  Some images in the dataset are not of the advertised shape (50 x 50) and are discarded."]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"z6IkViDI2K40","colab_type":"text"},"source":["## Perform imports"]},{"cell_type":"code","metadata":{"id":"cseanZoVoptC","colab_type":"code","colab":{}},"source":["import numpy as np\n","import matplotlib.pyplot as plt\n","from os import listdir"],"execution_count":0,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"mpqGpCxM2N0U","colab_type":"text"},"source":["## Load and save images as NumPy arrays"]},{"cell_type":"code","metadata":{"id":"1jt_nGxzoptH","colab_type":"code","colab":{}},"source":["# list to hold image arrays and list to hold labels\n","img_array_list = []\n","label_list = []\n","# local path folder holding all image subfolders\n","top_path = 'C:\\\\Users\\\\hsvjc\\\\Desktop\\\\Thinkful\\\\Final Capstone\\\\Images\\\\breast-histopathology-images'\n","# batch size counter\n","img_array_list_len = 0\n","# batch label counter\n","save_file_count = 1\n","# local path at which to save NumPy arrays\n","save_path = 'C:\\\\Users\\\\hsvjc\\\\Desktop\\\\Thinkful\\\\Final Capstone\\\\Images\\\\Image NumPy\\\\'\n","# loop through patient subfolders\n","for file in listdir(top_path):\n","    if (file != 'IDC_regular_ps50_idx5'):\n","        # loop through class subfolders\n","        new_path = top_path + '\\\\' + file\n","        for file2 in listdir(new_path):\n","            new_path2 = new_path + '\\\\' + file2\n","            # save the label for folder of images\n","            if (file2 == '0'):\n","                label = 0\n","            elif (file2 == '1'):\n","                label = 1\n","            else:\n","                print('Label problem')\n","            # loop through images\n","            for file3 in listdir(new_path2):\n","                filepath = new_path2 + '\\\\' + file3\n","                # read image\n","                img = plt.imread(filepath)\n","                # identify whether image shape is 50 x 50 x 3 and add image to list if so\n","                if (img.shape == (50, 50, 3)):\n","                    img_array_list.append(np.reshape(img, (1, 50, 50, 3), order='C'))\n","                    label_list.append(label)\n","                    img_array_list_len += 1\n","                # save a batch when number of images reaches 100,000\n","                if (img_array_list_len == 100000):\n","                    # array of images\n","                    X_concat = np.concatenate(img_array_list, axis=0)\n","                    # array of labels corresponding to image based on index\n","                    Y = np.array(label_list)\n","                    np.save(save_path + 'X' + str(save_file_count), X_concat)\n","                    np.save(save_path + 'Y' + str(save_file_count), Y)\n","                    save_file_count += 1\n","                    img_array_list = []\n","                    label_list = []\n","                    img_array_list_len = 0\n","# save last batch\n","X_concat = np.concatenate(img_array_list, axis=0)\n","Y = np.array(label_list)\n","np.save(save_path + 'X' + str(save_file_count), X_concat)\n","np.save(save_path + 'Y' + str(save_file_count), Y)"],"execution_count":0,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"HZ6q-2j_4wxs","colab_type":"text"},"source":["After the batches of NumPy arrays were saved, those NumPy files were uploaded to Google Drive so that they could be used with Google Colab for greater processing power."]},{"cell_type":"code","metadata":{"id":"xO3y5oxb4-eH","colab_type":"code","colab":{}},"source":[""],"execution_count":0,"outputs":[]}]}
